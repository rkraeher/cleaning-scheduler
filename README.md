# ðŸ«§ &nbsp; Cleaning Calculator &nbsp; ðŸ§®

This project is a small, niche website that offers a UI for running a script on user-provided spreadsheet data. The script accepts an `.xlsx` file, processes the data to evenly divide the room cleaning duties in half, and outputs a list for the hotel receptionist/manager to get an overview of all the rooms as well as two separate lists to provide to the cleaners with their room assignments.

## Features

- Upload cleaning data via Excel spreadsheet. Script uses [SheetJS](https://docs.sheetjs.com/) to process the data.
- Automatically balance and distribute cleaning tasks across different rooms.
- Download organized cleaning schedules in Excel format.
- User-friendly interface with a retro, Windows 95 aesthetic, courtesy of [react95](https://github.com/react95-io/React95)
